                    " Directions (1-6): Read the following passage and answer the given questions. Some words are highlighted to help you answer the questions. <br><br>Technology is growing by leaps and bounds. Innovation and disruption have become everyday phenomena. A technology driven organization is a company whose business model, innovation strategy, and growth are technology-centric. Advancements in technology not only help industries to function at a faster pace, but they also help to minimize human effort and increase the efficiency of production. At the same time, technology is also becoming an increasing factor for increasing unemployment.<br> Technology is ___(I)___ to a variety of avenues of new scientific discoveries and developments. Some of these developments are artificial intelligence, 3D printing, self- driven vehicles, and robotics. As a result, technology has started creating employment for skilled professionals. Also, considering automation in agriculture and manufacturing. This has opened opportunities for people who can drive machines and even for companies which work on automation technology. Along with the growth ofjobs in the automation sector, dependent industries start growing. For example, with increasing automation in manufacturing, research and development in supply chain and logistics grows. Hence, technology has been a boon considering the number of jobs it continues to create. Given the fact that these developments in technology are endless, employment opportunities too will see an ever-increasing graph, more so in talent-rich countries such as India and China. However, the immediate result of technological advancements is observed as losses in employment. This is because, with the growth in technology, more and more manual tasks are replaced by machines. This makes more and more jobs redundant as machines guarantee efficiency as well as are a cost-effective alternative to human employees. This forces people to continuously update themselves and hence leads to survival of the fittest. This can be hard on an unskilled workforce which has no access to skill development training or to education.<br> Although some of the studies are close when it comes to predictions up to 2020-2021, jumping ahead a decade the numbers become incomprehensibly bigger. To think that only 1.8 million jobs will go within the next two years, and ten years later that figure increases by half a million or more, is difficult to accept. But, change is coming, and as the technology becomes more prevalent and embedded within different sectors of the economy, it could be far reaching and rapid.<br> The 2017 McKinsey study also assesses degrees of automation and revealed a now well documented statistic. 60% of occupations have at least 30% of constituent work activities that can be automated. It further states that although half of all jobs have the technical potential to become automated based on currently available technologies, due to social, economic and technical factors, the rate of adoption will be varied and slow. However, over 200 million global workers will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 and most likely re-train because of role changes.The intervention of technology in any domain has become absolutely inevitable. <br>The wonders of technology are such that it has not just boosted productivity and efficiency, but also the level of safety which would have been unachievable by humans alone. Faster communication, rapid transactions, global reach are all by-products of growth in technology. However, most policymakers are neither keyed in nor in pace, and we could be frittering away these growth opportunities as a result. We can, therefore, conclude by saying that although technology in terms of automation has reduced jobs for unskilled people, it has outgrown the growth in employment in other areas. This can be dealt with a shift of people from unskilled to specially-skilled employees. This change will further enhance the growth of people, their employability, their pay scales, basic income and purchasing power of people,leading the world to development alone. <hr> Which of the following sentence (s) is/are true according to the context of the passage?<br>(i) Technology and automation have compressed the opportunities for dependent industries.<br>(ii) Technical advancement is forcing people to continuously update their knowledge to sustain in the job market<br>(iii) Even though some jobs will become redundant, technological advancement has the potential to create many more employment opportunities.",
